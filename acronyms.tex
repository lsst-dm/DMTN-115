Object & In LSST nomenclature this refers to an astronomical object, such as a star, galaxy, or other physical entity. E.g., comets, asteroids are also Objects but typically called a Moving Object or a Solar System Object (SSObject). One of the DRP data products is a table of Objects detected by LSST which can be static, or change brightness or position with time. \\\hline
POSIX & Portable Operating System Interface \\\hline
VO & Virtual Observatory \\\hline
metadata & General term for data about data, e.g., attributes of astronomical objects (e.g. images, sources, astroObjects, etc.) that are characteristics of the objects themselves, and facilitate the organization, preservation, and query of data sets. (E.g., a FITS header contains metadata). \\\hline
