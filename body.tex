\section{Recommendation }
We should  expose file systems and static name spaces.  Data needs to breath. We should use a common abstraction which allows users to work flexibly and not worrying about the data storage beneath.

\section{Why do we recommend these things?}
Filesystems with name spaces are very fragile at large scale. As we get larger data sets we have to trick the filesystem to not run out of Inodes, we make countless sub directories to cope with our thousands of files.
This is turn leads to countless hours spent fighting over how to organize files  the \emph{right way} in a filesystem.
Countless years have been spent fighting over data formats (FITS vs HDF vs CVS vs Pandas).
If we move code then perhaps the filesystem is not organised in the same manner and the code may not work - remote access to allow caching is not always an option.


\section{What should  we do ?}
Users should not care and repositories should not be tied to legacy formats  and storage representations because of legacy constraints  at other repositories.
The rest of the world has already moved on,  Google, Amazon, Git, netflix etc. do not host large filesystems and and can scale because they are not limited by this antiquated formalism.

Everyone hates object stores  yet this is what underlies the big silicon valley outfits - we should expose a layer which finds appropriate data using metadata queries and returns that data formatted for the applications requesting it.
.
Meta data -- how do we treat it what is it ..  tagging?  Translations...make this part of the data agent (aka butler)
Dynamic data structuring (more than just here is your dict of data and metadata..but transformations into API consumable pieces).  Knows how to consume...knows how to export in different ways

This "Infrastructure as Code" \citep{morris2016infrastructure} approach lowers the bar to entry
and allows for easier adoption of more standardized services that will enable large-scale
astronomical research in ways that are well demonstrated in plant genomics (CyVerse and Galaxy), natural hazards (Designsafe), and surface water research (Hydroshare).
